# Week 2: Implementing Callbacks in TensorFlow using the MNIST Dataset
In the lectures you learned how to do classification using Fashion MNIST, a dataset containing items of clothing. There's another, similar dataset called MNIST which has items of handwriting -- the digits 0 through 9.

In this assignment you will code a classifier for the MNIST dataset, that trains until it reaches 98% accuracy and stops once this threshold is achieved. In the lectures you saw how this was done for the loss but here you will be using accuracy instead.

Some notes:

Your network should succeed in less than 10 epochs.
When it reaches 98% or greater it should print out the string "Reached 98% accuracy so cancelling training!" and stop training.
TIPS FOR SUCCESSFUL GRADING OF YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
All cells are frozen except for the ones where you need to submit your solutions or when explicitly mentioned you can interact with it.

You can add new cells to experiment but these will be omitted by the grader, so don't rely on newly created cells to host your solution code, use the provided places for this.

You can add the comment # grade-up-to-here in any graded cell to signal the grader that it must only evaluate up to that point. This is helpful if you want to check if you are on the right track even if you are not done with the whole assignment. Be sure to remember to delete the comment afterwards!

Avoid using global variables unless you absolutely have to. The grader tests your code in an isolated environment without running all cells from the top. As a result, global variables may be unavailable when scoring your submission. Global variables that are meant to be used will be defined in UPPERCASE.

To submit your notebook, save it and then click on the blue submit button at the beginning of the page.

# Load and inspect the data
Begin by loading the data. A couple of things to notice:

The file mnist.npz is already included in the current workspace under the data directory. By default the load_data from Keras accepts a path relative to ~/.keras/datasets but in this case it is stored somewhere else, as a result of this, you need to specify the full path.

tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data returns the train and test sets in the form of the tuples (training_images, training_labels), (testing_images, testing_labels) but in this exercise you will be needing only the train set so you can ignore the second tuple.

# Get current working directory
current_dir = os.getcwd()

# Append data/mnist.npz to the previous path to get the full path
data_path = os.path.join(current_dir, "data/mnist.npz")

# Load data (discard test set)
(training_images, training_labels), _ = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data(path=data_path)

print(f"training_images is of type {type(training_images)}.\ntraining_labels is of type {type(training_labels)}\n")

# Inspect shape of the data
data_shape = training_images.shape

print(f"There are {data_shape[0]} examples with shape ({data_shape[1]}, {data_shape[2]})")

training_images is of type <class 'numpy.ndarray'>.
training_labels is of type <class 'numpy.ndarray'>

There are 60000 examples with shape (28, 28)
One important step is to normalize the pixel values. The dataset includes black and white images and the pixel values for these kinds of images usually range from 0 to 255 but the network will have an easier time learning if these values range from 0 to 1.

The data comes as numpy arrays so you can easily normalize the pixel values by using vectorization:

# Normalize pixel values
training_images = training_images / 255.0

Exercise 1: create_and_compile_model
Your first task is to create and compile the model that you will later train to recognize handwritten digits.

Feel free to try the architecture for the neural network that you see fit but in case you need extra help you can check out an architecture that works pretty well at the end of this notebook. Notice that the part where the model is compiled is already provided (and the accuracy metric is defined so it can be accessed by your callback later on) so you only need to specify the layers of the model.

Hints:

The first layer should take into consideration the input_shape of the data, which in this case is the size of each image
The last layer should take into account the number of classes you are trying to predict


# GRADED FUNCTION: create_and_compile_model

def create_and_compile_model():
    """Returns the compiled (but untrained) model.

    Returns:
        tf.keras.Model: The model that will be trained to predict handwriting digits.
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ###
        
    # Define the model
    model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([ 
        tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),  # Flatten the input images
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # Hidden layer with 128 neurons
        tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Output layer with 10 classes
    ]) 

    ### END CODE HERE ###
    
    # Compile the model
    model.compile(
        optimizer='adam',
        loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
        metrics=['accuracy']
    )

    return model




The next cell allows you to check the number of total and trainable parameters of your model and prompts a warning in case these exceeds those of a reference solution, this serves the following 3 purposes listed in order of priority:

Helps you prevent crashing the kernel during training.

Helps you avoid longer-than-necessary training times.

Provides a reasonable estimate of the size of your model. In general you will usually prefer smaller models given that they accomplish their goal successfully.

Notice that this is just informative and may be very well below the actual limit for size of the model necessary to crash the kernel. So even if you exceed this reference you are probably fine. However, if the kernel crashes during training or it is taking a very long time and your model is larger than the reference, come back here and try to get the number of parameters closer to the reference.






# Save untrained model in a variable
untrained_model = create_and_compile_model()

# Check parameter count against a reference solution
unittests.parameter_count(untrained_model)





# Use it to predict the first 5 images in the train set
predictions = untrained_model.predict(training_images[:5], verbose=False)

print(f"predictions have shape: {predictions.shape}")


# Test your code!
unittests.test_create_and_compile_model(create_and_compile_model)




Exercise 2: EarlyStoppingCallback
Now it is time to create your own custom callback. For this complete the EarlyStoppingCallback class and the on_epoch_end method in the cell below. If you need some guidance on how to proceed, check out this link.


# GRADED CLASS: EarlyStoppingCallback

import tensorflow as tf

### START CODE HERE ###

# Inherit from the Keras Callback class
class EarlyStoppingCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):

    # Override the on_epoch_end method
    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        
        # Check if the accuracy is greater or equal to 0.98
        if logs.get('accuracy') >= 0.98:
            
            # Stop training once the above condition is met
            self.model.stop_training = True
            print("\nReached 98% accuracy so cancelling training!")

### END CODE HERE ###



# Test your code!
unittests.test_EarlyStoppingCallback(EarlyStoppingCallback)





Exercise 3: train_mnist
Now that you have defined your callback it is time to complete the train_mnist function below. This function will receive the training data (features and targets encoded as numpy arrays) and should use it to train the model you defined earlier. It should also return the training history of the model. This object is returned when using the fit method of a tf.keras.Model as explained in the docs.

You must set your model to train for 10 epochs and the callback should fire before the 10th epoch for you to pass this part of the assignment




# GRADED FUNCTION: train_mnist

def train_mnist(training_images, training_labels):
    """Trains a classifier of handwritten digits.

    Args:
        training_images (numpy.ndarray): The images of handwritten digits
        training_labels (numpy.ndarray): The labels of each image

    Returns:
        tf.keras.callbacks.History : The training history.
    """

    ### START CODE HERE ###

    # Create a compiled (but untrained) version of the model
    model = create_and_compile_model()
    
    # Create an instance of the EarlyStoppingCallback
    early_stopping = EarlyStoppingCallback()
    
    # Fit the model for 10 epochs adding the callbacks and save the training history
    history = model.fit(
        training_images, 
        training_labels, 
        epochs=10, 
        callbacks=[early_stopping]
    )

    ### END CODE HERE ###

    return history



training_history = train_mnist(training_images, training_labels)




# Test your code!
unittests.test_training_history(training_history)
